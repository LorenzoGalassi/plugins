# Hidden Field DatoCMS plugin

This is the simplest field editor ever,
it just hides the input from the DatoCMS UI!

Suppose you are storing some data in DatoCMS through the API,
it makes no sense to make this data editable by editors, right?
So, just hide it!

## Configuration

No need for configuration, just add this plugin to any field type
and no-one will be able to see it.
