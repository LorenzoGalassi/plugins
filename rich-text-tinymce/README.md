# Rich text DatoCMS plugin

This plugin uses the [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/) Rich text HTML editor.

It is the same DatoCMS uses for its HTML multi-paragraph field but, since TinyMCE offers a great deal of customization, this plugin will help users configure their own editor.

To read more about TinyMCE and all its options and plugins read the [the official documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/)
